Dakos or ntakos, also known as koukouvagia or koukouvayia or—in eastern Crete—kouloukopsomo, is a Cretan meze consisting of a slice of soaked dried bread or barley rusk topped with chopped tomatoes and crumbled feta or mizithra cheese, and flavored with herbs such as dried oregano. Olives and pepper can also be added.

It originated from Greece in the 19th century and is a well known Greek dish outside and inside Greece.
